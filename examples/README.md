# Examples

This directory contains working examples across different approaches to computer-assisted music creation.

## 📂 Current Examples

### [strudel/](strudel/)
**Algorithmic live coding for audio creation**

Examples showing how to create music through code patterns using Strudel (browser-based TidalCycles port).

- 12 hands-on patterns from basic to advanced
- Deep comparison: Algorithmic vs AI vs Context Warming
- Shows precise, deterministic audio creation

**Philosophy**: Code as instrument. Patterns as composition.

## 🌱 The Emerging Pattern

As we explore different approaches, a pattern is emerging across two dimensions:

```
AUDIO CREATION              ←→              VISUAL CREATION
      ↓                                          ↓
   Strudel                                  AlaskaButter
(Code → Sound)                          (Sound → Visuals)
Algorithmic                              AI-Curated
                                         Algorithmic

   AI Music                             music_autovis
(AI → Sound)                         (Sound → Video)
Neural generation                    Production pipeline


Context Warming
(Conversation → Sound)
Emergent collaboration
```

**Current state**: This repo explores **audio creation** (left column).

**Future possibility**: The **visual creation** symmetry exists in our other projects ([AlaskaButter](https://alaskabutter.com), music_autovis), but we haven't connected the dots here yet.

**Why note this?**: Because the pattern is interesting. Because symmetry feels alive. Because maybe examples showing **both dimensions together** want to emerge.

Not forcing it. Just... noticing. 🌊

## 💭 Questions Warming in the Background

- Could we show Strudel patterns **visualized** with Butterchurn in real-time?
- Is there a "context warming" equivalent for visuals? (Conversation → Visuals?)
- Does the algorithmic approach work differently for audio vs. visual?
- What would a complete example look like: Create sound + Generate matching visuals?

**These aren't TODOs.** They're questions that might want to become examples. Or might not.

We're on the journey. 🌊

## 🤝 Contributing Examples

If you've explored these approaches and created something interesting:

**Audio Examples:**
- Context warming conversation transcripts
- AI music generation experiments
- Strudel patterns with novel techniques

**Visual Examples:**
- Butterchurn preset selection algorithms
- Audio-reactive visual programming
- AI-curated visualization systems

**Hybrid Examples:**
- Audio + Visual creation together
- Cross-domain pattern exploration
- Novel combinations we haven't thought of

Open an issue or PR. Let's explore together.
